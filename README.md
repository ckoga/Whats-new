# What's New?

This application was built with `create-react-app`.
Testing was done with enzyme.

What's new is a news application that displays news by category. On page load a user will see local news displayed, by selecting any of the news categories in the menu component on the left a user can change the news being displayed.  Each news bit contains a headline, image, description, and link a user can click the link of any interesting article and it will direct the user to the source page.  Finally a user is able to search through a category for a specific story using keywords that will be compared to the headline and description.  

## Setup
Fork and clone down the repository, then install the dependencies run 
```npm install```
then
```npm start```
If everything was installed correctly you will see:
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view whats-new in the browser.
